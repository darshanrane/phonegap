PhoneGap Source Codes

These folder contains some of the test code I had worked upon while learning PhoneGap.

Most of the code is replica of the code available on PhoneGap Site.

The code can be compiled and executed as an Android App using PhoneGap Build.

4 Apps cover PhoneGap Basic, Events - Notifications, Plugins, Storage using SQLite DB.
